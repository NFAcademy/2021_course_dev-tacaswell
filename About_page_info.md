## Title

Scientific Visualization and Programming with Matplotlib

## sub-title
From exploration to publication

## Time
3 hours

## Description (<1000 chars)

This course starts with exploratory data analysis of a (simulated) physical system and ends with figures suitable for publication.  Along the way we will develop a mini-library for visualizing and analyzing the data.  We will discuss the reasoning behind the API choices made and the trade-offs to get a set of composable, reusable, tools that will be adaptable for both future data and alternative visualization needs, such as re-making the figures for a talk or poster.

## Short Description (<150 chars)

Starting with exploratory data analysis design and build tools to make a publication-ready figure.

## Learning outcomes

- Learn how to write re-usable and composable function for visualization.
- Learn how to approach the explicit Matplotlib API and wrap it for your needs.
- Learn the basic considerations of API design for scientific programming.
