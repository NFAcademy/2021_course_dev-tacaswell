    "What is going on is that the default value of *b* is evaluated once when the function is defined.  Each subsequent call, when not explicitly passed *b*, uses the same `list` instance, hence the length of *b* keeps growing!  While this can be exploited for inter-call caching / memmoization, it is probably better to reach for `functools.lrucache`."
