* Matplotlib: From Exploration To Final Figure

** Just Plot it

Goals:
 - set up the scenario
 - familiarize student with the data structure we will be working with
 - "just put in on the screen"
 - x-array helper
 - write your own helper(s)

** Do some fitting and smoothing

Goals:

 - data reduction (it is all just arrays!)
 - use of structured data (xarray, pandas) to track results
 - write helper functions (to do reduction)

## Lesson 2:
- plot the offset data labeled with derived values

Learning Goals:

1. ax.annotation exists and is very powerful
2. (built in) latex support exists
3. (usetex) latex support exists
4. write helper functions  (to do plotting)

## Lesson 3:

- put the axes from Lesson 2 and Lesson 1 in same figure
- use subplots
- use add_axes
- use subplot_mosaic
- use constrained_layout
- adjust figure size

Learning Goals:

1. Figure layout tools
2. write helper function to make paper figure
